LikeSorter
=========

Working here: http://immense-earth-8429.herokuapp.com/

I love discovering and listening to music on Soundcloud but their interface can be a bit slow.

LikeSorter lets me explore/find my Soundcloud likes more easily and discover new music by seeing what my favorite artists like on Soundcloud.

Hope it helps you find some new tunes.

Feel free to give feedback on code/design/whatever. This is my first Angular app.
